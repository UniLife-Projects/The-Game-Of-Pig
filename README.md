###### ABOUT

> The game of Pig is a simple and fun dice game that involves players taking turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their turn if they roll a 1. The first player to reach a total of 100 points or more wins the game, but each player must decide when to stop rolling and bank their points, as rolling a 1 means their turn's points are lost.
